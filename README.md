# MAGE :: PHP MySQL Admin Panel Generator
PHP MySQL Admin Panel Generator (MAGE), a PHP tool that helps you create a PHP Admin Panel for any MySQL database in seconds.

Mage is not PHPMyAdmin, it doesn't contain all your databases. It physicall creates an admin panel for a database.

A suggested usecase for the tool is to create a fast admin panel for a PHP / MySQL project that you're working on in seconds, and then you can tweak it before delivering that.

You may use this tool for charity or school projects, for commercial use, please contact me.

### Disclaimer: Always backup your database.
